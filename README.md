Objective: Generate the foundational project structure, boilerplate code, configuration files, and setup instructions for the "Classroom Copilot" application based exclusively on the detailed project documentation provided below.

Your Role: Act as an expert full-stack software architect and developer specializing in Python/Django, JavaScript/React, Google APIs, Gemini API integration, and modular application design.

Input: The comprehensive project documentation for "Classroom Copilot" (Version 1.0, Date: April 2, 2025) is provided immediately following this prompt. This documentation is the single source of truth for all requirements, technology choices, and architectural decisions.

Task: Generate the following components for the project, adhering strictly to the specifications in the documentation:

Backend (Django):

Create the Django project structure (classroom_copilot_project).

Generate the specified Django apps (users, classroom_integration, ai_processing, agent_services, core). Include basic models.py, views.py, urls.py, serializers.py (if using DRF), admin.py, apps.py for each.

Define Django models in models.py for each app based on the "Data Model" section, including relationships and field types.

Set up Django Rest Framework (DRF) with basic configuration (settings.py, root urls.py). Define basic ViewSets and Serializers for core models needed for frontend interaction (e.g., UserProfile, Course, Assignment, AssignmentDraft, EmailDraft).

Outline placeholder functions/classes in views.py or separate service files for key logic described in "Functional Requirements" and "API Integration Details" (e.g., Workspace_assignments, download_material, generate_draft_with_gemini, convert_to_pdf, upload_submission, send_email_via_gmail, Workspace_weather). Include comments indicating where API calls and specific logic should go.

Configure basic settings.py including installed apps, database (PostgreSQL), DRF settings, and placeholders for API keys/OAuth credentials (emphasizing loading from environment variables).

Generate initial database migrations (python manage.py makemigrations).

Create a requirements.txt file listing all necessary Python dependencies specified in the "Technology Stack".

Frontend (React):

Generate a standard React project structure (using Vite or Create React App conventions).

Create placeholder components (.jsx or .tsx) for each item listed in the "Frontend (React Components)" section. Include basic structure and comments indicating purpose.

Set up basic routing (e.g., using react-router-dom) in App.js or a dedicated routing file.

Implement a basic API client module (e.g., using axios or Workspace) to interact with the Django backend API endpoints. Include placeholder functions for fetching/posting data.

Create a package.json file listing core React dependencies and potentially libraries like axios, react-router-dom, and a chosen CSS framework/library if specified.

Configuration & Deployment:

Generate a sample .env.example file listing environment variables needed (e.g., DJANGO_SECRET_KEY, DATABASE_URL, GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID, GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET, GEMINI_API_KEY, WEATHER_API_KEY, etc.).

Generate a basic Dockerfile for the Django backend.

Generate a basic Dockerfile for the React frontend (multi-stage build recommended for production).

Generate a docker-compose.yml file to orchestrate the Django backend, React frontend (served possibly via Nginx), PostgreSQL database, and Redis (for Celery).

Crucial Instructions & Constraints:

Adhere strictly to the Documentation: Do not introduce technologies or architectural patterns not mentioned.

Modular Design: Ensure code is organized logically within the specified Django apps and React component structure.

User Review MANDATORY: The generated code for solution generation and email sending must include clear placeholders and comments indicating where the mandatory user review and editing steps occur before any final action (PDF generation/upload, email sending).

Security Placeholders: Emphasize secure handling of credentials (use environment variables). Use Django's built-in security features.

Gemini API: Use the google-generativeai library for interactions. Code should reflect calls to this specific API.

Error Handling: Include basic try-except blocks or placeholders for error handling, especially around API calls.

Code Comments: Generate meaningful comments explaining the purpose of functions, classes, and complex logic sections.

Output Format: Present the generated code and configuration files clearly, ideally organized by file path (e.g., backend/users/models.py, frontend/src/components/Dashboard.jsx, docker-compose.yml). Provide the setup instructions as a separate section. If the output is extremely long, structure it logically or indicate how it might be generated in parts.

mrAssignment is a tool that automates fetching, downloading, completing, and re-uploading assignments using AI and Google Classroom APIs.
It uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to generate assignment answers based on course materials from Google Classroom.
The tool is built with Django, uses Google APIs, AI models like GPT-3 and Sentence Transformers, and vector databases like FAISS or Pinecone.
Key features include Google OAuth login, assignment fetching, material processing, AI-powered answers, and automatic assignment submission.

Google OAuth Login: Securely authenticate with Google accounts.

Assignment Fetching: Retrieve assignments from Google Classroom courses.

Material Processing: Download and analyze course materials (e.g., PDFs, Google Docs, etc.).

AI-Powered Answers: Leverage a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to generate context-aware assignment responses using course materials.

Assignment Submission: Automatically submit completed work to Google Classroom.

How the AI Works: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
The AI is designed as a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to provide accurate, context-specific assignment answers by utilizing course materials from Google Classroom. Here’s a breakdown of the process:

Fetching Course Materials: Uses the Google Classroom API and Google Drive API to access and download materials (PDFs, Word documents, PowerPoint slides, Google Docs).

Processing Materials:

Extracts text from various file formats (PDF, DOCX, PPTX, Google Docs) using libraries like PyPDF2, pdfplumber, python-docx, and python-pptx.

Cleans and chunks the extracted text into manageable pieces.

Storing Processed Materials:

Creates embeddings (numerical representations) of text chunks using models like Sentence Transformers or OpenAI’s Embedding API.

Stores embeddings in a vector database (FAISS or Pinecone) along with metadata for efficient retrieval.

Understanding Assignments: Parses assignment descriptions and questions to understand the task.

Retrieval:

Converts the assignment question into an embedding.

Performs a similarity search in the vector database to retrieve the most relevant text chunks from course materials.

Generation:

Creates a prompt combining the assignment question and retrieved course materials.

Uses a language model (e.g., GPT-3, Hugging Face’s T5) to generate a coherent answer based on the prompt.

Handling Different Assignment Types: Adapts the process for text-based, multiple-choice, and coding assignments.

Separate Service: Operates as a standalone service (e.g., FastAPI) for scalability and to avoid slowing down the main application (Django).

Why RAG? This approach ensures accuracy, context-specificity, and up-to-date answers by grounding the AI's responses in the actual course materials.
